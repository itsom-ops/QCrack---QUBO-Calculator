Welcome to the **QUBO Calculator**, a deeply engineered repository that merges theoretical elegance with hands-on quantum computing. Designed for professional demonstrations, academic competitions, and cryptographic disruption, this project showcases mastery over some of the most advanced quantum algorithms in contemporary computation.

> This is not a hobbyist demo. This is a command center for simulating quantum supremacy over classical boundaries.

## ðŸ§  Project Philosophy

In an era where classical computation begins to falter under exponential complexity, quantum computing emerges not just as a tool â€” but as a paradigm shift. This repository embraces that shift, and presents a **multi-algorithmic arsenal**:

- Factoring large integers using **Shorâ€™s Algorithm** to challenge RSA encryption.
- Precise phase extraction with **Quantum Phase Estimation** (QPE).
- Custom construction of the **Quantum Fourier Transform** (QFT) â€” the backbone of quantum signal analysis.
- Solving discrete binary optimization problems via **QUBO** formulation using **QAOA**.

Whether youâ€™re simulating quantum attacks on encryption or optimizing NP-hard problems, this repo is built to **execute, analyze, and awe**.

## ðŸ§¬ Core Quantum Systems Implemented

### 1. **Shor's Algorithm**
Factorizes a composite number \( N \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \) using quantum period finding and classical post-processing:
```python
factor_integer(21)
# Output: [3, 7]
```
Used to demonstrate the cryptographic vulnerability of RSA-based security.

### 2. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**
Builds and applies an n-qubit QFT:
```python
circuit = create_qft_circuit(3)
circuit.draw()
```
QFT is the core of many quantum protocols â€” this implementation is exact and swappable into larger algorithms.

### 3. **Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**
Estimates the eigenphase \( \phi \) of a unitary operator \( U \) applied to an eigenvector \( |\psi\rangle \):
```python
qc = qpe_circuit(unitary, eigenstate, 4)
simulate_qpe(qc)
```
Crucial for chemistry, HHL, and beyond.

### 4. **QUBO Solver with QAOA**
Solves binary quadratic optimization problems like Max-Cut, graph coloring, etc.:
```python
simple_qubo_problem()
# Returns optimal bitstring and cost
```
